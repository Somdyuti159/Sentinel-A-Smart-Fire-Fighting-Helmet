# Sentinel-A-Smart-Fire-Fighting-Helmet
Fire-fighting has been a problem since the medieval ages. Even with the advent of modern technology , we haven â€™t been able to reduce fire accidents significantly . Our proposed project aims to use all relevant data, to remedy any fire accident. The project uses a variety of sensors and the collected data is processed and utilized to alert authorities and display meaningful results . All our sensors are integrated with one central Micro -controller . The Micro-controller is responsible for relaying the data to a shared database , from where the processed data is retrieved. Location data will be broadcast from the server to all clients in the nearby area.
