# Sentinel-A-Smart-Fire-Fighting-Helmet
Fire-fighting has been a problem since the medieval ages. Even with the advent of modern technology , we haven â€™t been able to reduce fire accidents significantly . Our proposed project aims to use all relevant data, to remedy any fire accident. The project uses a variety of sensors and the collected data is processed and utilized to alert authorities and display meaningful results . All our sensors are integrated with one central Micro -controller . The Micro-controller is responsible for relaying the data to a shared database , from where the processed data is retrieved. Location data will be broadcast from the server to all clients in the nearby area.

The circuit diagram is created using circuit.io platform.

The main idea of this project is to monitor the physical parameters around the fire-fighter in hazardous situations , the whole project is supposed to be mounted on the helmet of the individual. The parameters needed to be monitored are temperature, humidity, air condition i.e. levels of toxic and inflammable gases in the atmosphere nearby including the
atmospheric pressure of the area.


There will be two interfaces of the project a mobile application and a web interface . The mobile application which will report any abrupt change and will be used to send SOS
message to call for help and the web interface will be monitored by someone from outside so just in case if anything goes wrong or in case of abrupt parameter change, one can send
help from outside.
